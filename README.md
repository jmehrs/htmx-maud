## Development

Navigate to the `api/` directory then run `cargo watch -x run` to have the code rebuilt automatically when a change is detected.

The application starts on [http://localhost:3000] by default. The application does not support auto-reloading the browser when there is a code change, therefore you will have to manually refresh the page when the application is rebuilt.
